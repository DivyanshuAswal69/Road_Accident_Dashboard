The "Road Accident Dashboard" is an Excel-based tool that provides a detailed analysis of road accidents. This dashboard aims to help users visualize and understand key performance indicators (KPIs) related to road accidents, including fatal casualties, serious casualties, slight casualties, and car casualties. By using this dashboard, users can gain valuable insights into accident trends, identify potential areas for improvement, and make informed decisions to enhance road safety.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
